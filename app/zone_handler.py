    The ACME client sends the full domain including the

    leading ``*.`` if present for wildcard certs), then attempts to
    find a matching ``.zone`` file by trying progressively shorter
    domain suffixes.

    For example, ``_acme-challenge.sub.example.com`` first tries
    ``<zone_path>/sub.example.com.zone``, then
    ``<zone_path>/example.com.zone``, and returns the first match.
    This lets the same webhook serve domains that belong to different
    zones managed in the same repository.

    The resolved path is validated to stay within the allowed base
    directory as a defence-in-depth measure against path traversal
    attacks — even though the ``domain`` field is already validated
    by a Pydantic regex pattern in ``AcmeRequest``.

    Uses dnspython to parse the existing Bind zone file, clear any

    Only a single TXT value is kept per challenge name — this matches
